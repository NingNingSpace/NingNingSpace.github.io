                    Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm so glad you're here. 
                    Let me share a bit about who I am and what makes me... well, me!

                    Hi! My name is Nurul Najwa Ayuni binti Ibaharim@Ibrahim. Some people ask, “Why Nini?” Well… it just stuck, and honestly, I kinda like it! But you can also call me Nurul, Najwa, Ayuni… or Princess, if you're feeling fancy. 😌✨<br><br>
                    I’m 20 years old, proudly from Perak, and just someone who enjoys the little things in life. I love keeping things light, having fun, and finding small moments that make every day feel a bit happier.
                </p>

                <h3>🎀 My Personality</h3>

                <p>
                    People often describe me as creative, friendly, playful, and passionate, but honestly, I’m more of an easy-going, warm person once you get to know me. I love learning new things, having fun, and enjoying the little cute moments in life.
                    <br><br>
                    Even though I can be playful and outgoing, I’m actually shy and introverted at first. Once I’m comfortable, I’m super chill, approachable, and easy to get along with. I really enjoy connecting with people who share the same vibes and values. 💗✨
                </p>

                <!-- DREAMS & GOALS -->
                <h3>💭 My Dreams & Goals</h3>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I dream of having a stable, meaningful career that allows me to support myself and, most importantly, take care of my parents. I want to make them proud and help them achieve the dreams they had to set aside.
                    <br><br>
                    I also want a future where I can stand on my own feet and help people who need kindness, support, and hope. Success means nothing if I can’t use it to lift others up. 💕
                </p>
