                <h2>My Study Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my study space! Here I share my academic journey, 
                    study tips, favorite resources, and everything related to learning. 
                    Whether you're a fellow student or just curious about my studies, 
                    I hope you find something helpful here!
                </p>
                
                <h3>📖 What I'm Studying (2023-Present)</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm a Diploma student in Information Management at UiTM Merbok, and this journey has truly been meaningful.
                    I’m passionate about studying and organizing information because my course involves a lot of reading, understanding, and note-taking, but Alhamdulillah, I enjoy all my subjects.
                    Life at UiTM has been amazing—my friends are always there to support me, and my lecturers are incredibly helpful, which makes learning much more enjoyable.
                    Even though I sometimes feel burnt out from studying, I can’t believe I’m already close to finishing my diploma, time has passed so quickly and I’ve made so many memories along the way.
                    I believe that studying should be enjoyable and sustainable, so I focus on understanding rather than memorization, creating aesthetic notes, and using active recall to strengthen what I learn.
                    Balance is important to me, so I always make sure to take breaks and practice self-care. My goal is to finish my diploma with excellent results, InshaAllah.
                </p>
                
                <h3>✨ My High School Life (2018-2022)</h3>
                <p>
                    I studied at SMK Sungai Acheh, Pulau Pinang, and my time there holds so many meaningful memories.
                    I was there from Form 4 to Form 5, and I took Sport Science, which made my school life even more enjoyable.
                    All my girlfriends were amazing, and the environment was comfortable and supportive, those were the years where we first started stepping into a more mature phase of life, learning how to grow, understand ourselves, and handle responsibilities.
                    I learned so much in secondary school, from building friendships to gaining knowledge that shaped who I am today.
                    A big part of the person I am now, especially in my journey to finish my diploma, comes from the lessons and experiences I gained back then.
                    Secondary school truly played a role in helping me grow and mature, Alhamdulillah.
                    I miss all my classmates who were always there to help and support me. And lastly, Al-Fatihah for Paan.
                </p>

                <h3>⏰ Time Management</h3>
                <p>
                    I use the Pomodoro Technique (25 min study, 5 min break) 
                    and plan my week every Saturday. Consistency is more important 
                    than long hours!

                <p>
                    I love making simple notes but understanable! I usually send a notes documents to chatgpt or gemini to ask them make it simple for me so it easier to be read and help me remember 
                    information better.

                    study with friends, and remember WHY I'm studying. REMEMBER!! Studying is not a competition, but a quiet process of learning, improving, and understanding the world around you.
